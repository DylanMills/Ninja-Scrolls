It is a PVP game which focuses on using the mouseâ€™s scroll wheel as the keybind for attacking.

There will be 2 main weapons, the Bow+Arrow, and the Shuriken.

To use the Bow+Arrow, you right click and hold it down to load the arrow, then scroll down with the scroll wheel to pull the arrow back and then release right click to release the arrow.

To use the shuriken, right click to hold it in your hand and push the scroll wheel up to throw the shuriken.

The artstyle will be cel-shaded. Environment will be low-lighting. There will be spotlights to add variety. Colors will be dark blue with warm yellow lighting in certain sections. There will be a glowing moon.
There will be lots of dynamic particle effects. Fireflies. Smoke/fog. Glowing windows. Bloom while being very prominent. NO motion blur. There will be a subtle blood effect when an arrow or shuriken successfully hits. There will be blur applied to the shurikens/arrows to emphasize speed. Upon getting a kill there will be a burst of light that illuminates the whole environment like a flash of lightning.

Combat will be usually very dark so the characters might look like they are just shadows/silhouettes.
