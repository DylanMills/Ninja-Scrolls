# Ninja-Scrolls
 Dylan Mills
This game uses the scroll wheel to charge up a bow and arrow. 

Right click to load arrow, you have to hold right click while scrolling back

Alternate weapon: shuriken/dart, involves pushing scroll wheel forward

The game is called The Ninja Scrolls

It is a PVP game which focuses on using the mouseâ€™s scroll wheel as the keybind for attacking.

There will be 2 main weapons, the Bow+Arrow, and the Shuriken.

To use the Bow+Arrow, you right click and hold it down to load the arrow, then scroll down with the scroll wheel to pull the arrow back and then release right click to release the arrow.

To use the shuriken, right click to hold it in your hand and push the scroll wheel up to throw the shuriken.

The artstyle will be cel-shaded. Environment will be low-lighting. There will be spotlights to add variety. Colors will be dark blue with warm yellow lighting in certain sections. There will be a glowing moon.
There will be lots of dynamic particle effects. Fireflies. Smoke/fog. Glowing windows. Bloom while being very prominent. NO motion blur. There will be a subtle blood effect when an arrow or shuriken successfully hits. There will be blur applied to the shurikens/arrows to emphasize speed. Upon getting a kill there will be a burst of light that illuminates the whole environment like a flash of lightning.

Combat will be usually very dark so the characters might look like they are just shadows/silhouettes.

Shader Demonstration in Ninja Scrolls

## Work Process

- For this Shader Demo, I spent countless hours fine-tuning the colors/shaders to get the most aesthetic scene possible.
- I started with my sample-scene which was essentially empty and was just for gameplay-testing.
- I brought in a "Nuketown" model for the level since it is highly simple, iconic, and versatile in how it can be portrayed.
- I spent hours trying to figure out how to get the desired Toon Shading effect using URP Shader Graphs and following that,
- I began to work on setting win conditions.
- I decided that for the showcasing of several different shaders, I would swap the materials on the moving spherical targets that the player has to destroy. 
- I completed some more shaders using URP and then I got to work on set-dressing. 
- I made the terrain more dynamic rather than just flat, and I used a modified grass prefab brush to flesh out the organic feel of the map.
- After that the last thing to focus on was the color adjustment. 
- When I tried implementing the post-processing using the LUTs and Shader, I struggled to find a good way of implementing it into my URP scene.
- I decided to use an alternative method which uses the Volume Component where I could modify all the values in the inspector.
